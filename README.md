# nUberSoft-Framework
nUberSoft is a small in-the-works framework Library for PHP. It is a mix of old and new due to it's long development timeframe. Documentation is not as robust as it should be. The majority of this framework will work for non-Linux-based systems, but it is not tested and some security (.htaccess) are not read by Win servers.

The functions, classes, and namespaces are all fairly self-explanitory and usually are easy to follow along. The workings of the application can be automated using an xml file. This is the default for this application.
